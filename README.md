asm-printlib
============

Just some standard print routines. I'm putting these here for my own safekeeping, and so that people can give me tips/suggestions... But feel free to use them if you want to. I'm using NASM syntax and making Linux system calls, but those calls could probably be converted to DOS/whatever syscalls with relative ease.
